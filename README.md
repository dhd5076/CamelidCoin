CamelidCoin is a blockchain protocol designed for distributed large language model computation and training. Clients submit input for completion by a pool of compute nodes who are compensated in return. To ensure output validity, we propose a new algorithm called RASTiC which quickly verifies output authenticity with near certainty. Our protocol is built on the original Bitcoin model and has been modified to fit our use case.
