## CamelidCoin

A project with the goal to safely and securely incentivise an ad-hoc network of compute nodes to solve GPT model outputs for lightweight clients.

This entire project is based on the RASTiC algorithm which provides a way to confidently validate auto-regressive LLM output in O(1) time.
